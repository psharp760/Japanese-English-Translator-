5.     Any other remarks.
		We discovered that our DFA was incorrect after implementing scanner.cpp, 
		when we began debugging we were able to trace the error to our DFA and 
		found that some of our transition states were incorrect. This error was 
		permeated through our code and was causing our output to be off for 
		specific words. Once we fixed our DFA we were able to make the necessary 
		changes to our code to get it to function properly with no unexpected 
		behaviors.
